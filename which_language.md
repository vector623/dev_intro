# Which Programming Language Should I Learn?

If you want to learn how to program, but don't know where to start, here's a rough chart to help
understand at which levels of computing the different languages operate:

|  Computer level  |                 Other uses                  |          Languages          |           Web development purpose            |    Preferred Aptitudes     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Web Browser      | Web pages, Games, Mobile apps               | Javascript, Swift           | Frontend development, Presentation, UI logic | Communication, Art/Design  |
| Application      | AI, Databases, Games, Web apps, Mobile apps | Java, C#, SQL, Ruby, Python | Backend development, Business logic          | Business, Acounting        |
| Operating System | AI, Cloud/Devops                            | C++, C, Rust, Go            | Devops                                       | Engineering                |
| Drivers          | Robotics                                    | C, Assembly                 | N/A                                          | Engineering, Math          |
| Architecture     | Robotics                                    | Assembly, Microcode         | N/A                                          | Engineering, Math          |
| Circuitry        | Robotics                                    | Electricity and transistors | N/A                                          | Engineering, Math, Science |

Generally, if you're more artistically inclined, you'll be happier and more successful developing at
the top of the chart. At this level, you generally won't pay as much attention to what's going on at
the hardware/physical level. The code you write higher up on the chart is also slower. People mostly
experience software written at this level.

The more scientifically/mathematically inclined you are, you'll want to work lower on the chart. The
languages become more nuts and bolts and you need to worry a lot more about physical hardware.
Consequently, the code you write will run much faster. People generally won't interact directly with
your code as much. More often, it will interact with code on other levels, or on other systems;
example is a line of business application that synchronizes orders placed on an Amazon store with a
warehouse inventory system.

In general, designers/artists will do best to start with Javascript. For decently analytical people,
I'd recommend aiming for backend development and picking C#, or Java. More heavily mathematically
inclined people should probably start with C.

Even though Python operates further away from the hardware, there is a lot of scientific investment
into the Python language, which doesn't fit as neatly into my chart. There are some other
exceptions.

The point is not to tell you that where or where you can't use languages, but to give new learners
an idea of the general strengths and purposes of each language, to show which aptitudes are more
successful with those languages, and to suggest what kind of work they should probably aim for.

## What about salaries?

A lot of top search hits advising new coders seem to focus on average salaries. I don't think those
numbers will materialize for most people trying to get into coding after college.

If you start programming early on, in high school or earlier, and if you attend a decent computer
science program at college, you'll have plenty of time to figure out which kind of programming
language will suit you best. Start with any language and learn multiple languages, preferable on
different levels of this chart; mix up high level languages with low level ones. You'll know by the
time you graduate what you prefer. The average salaries tabulated from job postings on indeed.com
will probably make a difference to you.

For people getting started later and who don't have a CompSci degree, you will probably peak out
around $75,000-$85,000/year (relative to the Atlanta, GA area), regardless of your programming
language choice. Also, this is specific to stable companies, where you'd be working 40-50hrs per
week. You can always get significantly higher pay working for a startup, but these companies are
notoriously unstable and you will be working around 60-70 hours per week, if not more.

In general, I think it's more important to play to your strengths and preferences, rather than
picking one language because it has a $10k higher annual theoretical salary. If you're starting your
development career after college, that difference probably won't materialize for you.

## Market demand

If you want to know which programming language employs the most developers, it's been Java for at
least ten years. Next runner up is Javascript. However, other languages are growing more rapidly
than Java and Javascript, which have both peaked in my estimation.

Current job count isn't everything. It is more important, IMO, to look at whether a language is
increasing in popularity or decreasing. A growing language, even if its smaller, will see upward
pressure on salaries as demand outpaces growth. A language in decline, however, even if it employs a
large number of people, will show downward pressure on salaries because supply is outpacing demand.

Hope you find this useful!
